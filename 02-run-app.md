## Bat out of hell

Not completely without luck, you find that the previous developers have actually
    created README's for their code!

Try that and see how that flies for you.

### Task

- Install go on your cloud instance <https://go.dev/doc/install>
- Run to two seperate terminals for frontend & backend
- execute the below commands in the respective folder
- Build with `go build`
- Run both the frontend and backend with `go run frontend` & `go run backend` commands in the respective terminals
  Note: Ignore error message "connection refused" while executing the 'go run backend' command
- Familiarize yourself with the application (frontend and backend, try to add a cookie and re-run the backend)
